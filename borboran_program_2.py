# Program 1

# Write a program where the user can their name and then it will count how many vowels are there, Big and small.
# Ex. Danilo -> 3

# The code that I created:

# name_input = input("Enter your name:")
# vowels = ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"]
# count_vowels = vowels.count()
# print("count_vowels")
