PLD Finals

  As the finals was done, I didn't manage to run both programs that we need to create during a 5 to 10 minutes duration. but I still 
remembered the program that we need to doso I want to retry here to see if I can get it right. 

  As the finals has come, I would like to say my apologies to sir as to I didn't meet the expected outputs at the finals however, I can
assure you po sir that this will serve as a learning experience for me to keep moving forward. Just like what a wise man would say--
Failure is the key to Success!

  Thank you po sir for the First semester, I really had a lot of fun listening at your classes and creating codes even if sometimes it 
takes hours, days or weeks to make sure that the code would work perfectly fine. Looking forward to be our Professor again next semester!
